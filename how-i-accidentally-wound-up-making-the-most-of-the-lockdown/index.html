            <p>The more this lockdown drags on the clearer it becomes that Coronavirus isn't the only enemy we face in this crisis, boredom becomes an ever increasing threat. We may all like the idea of just being able to kick back, relax and do absolutely nothing when we're busy but humans actually like to have some sort of purpose and being bereft of such purpose can have negative consequences.</p>
            <p>This desire for activity we have can be seen on the internet with a massive increase in <a href="https://twitter.com/FootbalIStuff/status/1239184495200415746?s=20">dance videos on Twitter</a> and even the most <a href="https://twitter.com/timfarron/status/1240680716016459778">unlikeliest of people turning up on TikTok.</a> The nation is left with a store of pent up energy and as all the usual outlets for it are closed down we need to find other avenues.</p>
            <p>At the start of the crisis I was actually rather fortunate to find such an avenue and managed to go down a rabbit hole that has kept me occupied ever since. By nothing more than pure serendipity I wound up having to get my head around the intricacies of HTML to solve a particular problem I faced and it has since snowballed into an obsession about all things code related.</p>
            <p>It all started back in the faraway time of mid March when I got a phone call from a friend who I had done some graphic work for in the past. As it turns out he has a weekly email newsletter that he sends out to clients and wanted to make it all a bit more professional. The newsletter in question consisted of an attached Microsoft Word document and initially he wanted me to rejig the design.</p>
            <p>It was all very straightforward, I knocked up a new design and sent it back to him. So far so good but he later came back to me to see if we could get this design into the actual body of email and not just as an attached document, making it more akin to all the fancy promotional emails that populate your inbox. Now this wasn't totally unfamiliar territory to either of us as we'd both done something similar in the past using an email marketing service called <a href="https://mailchimp.com/">Mailchimp</a>.</p>
            <p>The major flaw in this plan was that while Mailchimp is a very good service it's also rather expensive and our budget for this particular endeavour consisted of &pound;0. Undeterred I took to Google safe in the knowledge that whatever you're looking for there's always a cheaper, or indeed free, alternative somewhere on the internet. Ten minutes later I'd found one and got composing.</p>
            <p>Everything started off great but as things went on they became less satisfactory. I was able to put together a nice, professional version of the newsletter but when I began to send out test emails it never turned out quite right at the other end. The text was always the wrong size, the whole formatting turned out funny or it didn't work on mobile.</p>
            <p>At this point I then had an epiphany. I realised that all those fancy promo emails you get are nothing more than mini websites and all services like Mailchimp do is embed the code that comprises them into an email via a simple interface. If none of these templates were working for me, I could just code one myself. How hard could it be?!</p>
            <p>Now believe it or not email marketing is actually a bit of a cottage industry so there are plenty of free templates online. After downloading a few I delved into their code and started to play around which went about as well as trying to build IKEA furniture without reading the instructions. Hopelessly out of my depth and in dire need of professional advice I went to where all those in a similar situation go, Youtube.</p>
            <p>Once there I quickly realised things were slightly more complicated than I had initially thought. Unbeknownst to me webpages and promotional emails actually consist of a combination of two programming languages, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bWPMSSsVdPk">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0afZj1G0BIE">Cascading Style Sheets (CSS)</a>. The former provides the actual contents and the latter provides the overall styling. Having already got this far I soldiered on and after a solid weekend chained to my computer, watching tutorial after tutorial, I finally got the newsletter together.</p>
            <p>With that out of the way and feeling far more accomplished than I probably deserved to I then began to think of other uses for my newfound skills. At the time I was applying for a few jobs so it occurred to me that I could now make a nice cover letter to stand out <a href="https://codepen.io/aaronrankin/pen/zYvxdpz">and that's just what I did.</a></p>
            <p>Now I was feeling suitably cocky I then turned attention to my own website to see what tinkering I could do. This led me to delving into how websites actually work with their various architectures and databases. As a result of this I quickly became dissatisfied with my site and set about rebuilding it from the ground up. Chained to my computer with Youtube, yet again, within a week I had a new site that I was much happier with and had even moved hosting companies.</p>
            <p>But I kept going and thinking about what more I could do. Naturally I began to investigate <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ukg_U3CnJWI">JavaScript</a>, the final part of the holy trinity of web development. Compared to HTML and CSS it is a very different kettle of fish and works more like a separate computer program that runs in a webpage. In approaching this I had to take baby steps and really drill down into the detail. Fortunately after more days of frustration and further YouTube tutorials I'd managed to get together some functions to implement on my site and they actually worked (eventually).</p>
            <p>After all this I can safely say that I've caught the coding bug and have recently begun to investigate other programming languages like Python, PHP and C. I's certainly a nice distraction from the troubled place our world has become and with added downtime that brings the new sense of purpose definitely helps pass the time. Another positive of my new passion is that it's very cheap, most of the tools you need to get started are free and as mentioned before YouTube alone provides a wealth of knowledge to draw on.</p>
            <p>To anyone out there who doesn't know what to do with themselves in this extended lockdown I can't recommend learning to code enough. Whilst the current situation may be a huge disruption to our lives it's also a great opportunity for self improvement. If we all use this time well then we come out the other end of this for the better. We now have the time to do that training course, learn that language we always wanted to learn or even just engage in much needed introspection.</p>
            <p>Once this is all over how good would it be to not look back on this time and think about all the things we could have done but instead think how we have grown. As The Queen <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2klmuggOElE">said in her address to the nation</a> two weeks ago "We will meet again" when that time comes let's make sure we have plenty to tell eachother.</p>
            <p>Stay safe everyone.</p>
