          <div class="blog-post">
            <p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jK8vjgVlc8A">Last night the Prime Minister Boris Johnson begrudgingly announced to the country that measures to counter the Coronavirus Pandemic had to be stepped up yet again.</a>  The past two weeks had seen a gradual ramping up of efforts to counter the virus with the rationale calmly explained by the Chief Medical Officer (CMO) and Chief Scientific Advisor (CSA) but a “lockdown” was always coming, it was just a question of when.</p>
            <p>In many ways this isn’t exactly our first rodeo, in recent years we’ve had a number of near misses.  The first instance of a potentially deadly virus in modern times that brought the prospect of such a pandemic into the public consciousness was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2002%E2%80%932004_SARS_outbreak">SARS back in 2002-2003</a>, however that was short lived and confined to particular areas.  Since then there have been further scares; <a href="http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4882824.stm">Bird Flu in 2005-2006</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2009_flu_pandemic">Swine Flu in 2009</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome">MERS in 2012</a>. Each of these had the potential to bring about a situation similar to today but due to a combination of luck and timely intervention they were halted, Coronavirus has been the time we haven’t been so lucky.</p>
            <p>This very real threat hasn’t escaped the attention of the government, strategies on how to respond to a flu pandemic have been developed for years <a href="https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/344695/PI_Response_Plan_13_Aug.pdf">with the most recent review having happened in 2014.</a>  While no plan survives contact with the enemy we do have a framework from which to deal with the situation and the government has proved nimble in responding to the near hourly developments.</p>
            <p>In the rapidly changing circumstances the new Chancellor Rishi Sunak <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-51832634">re-wrote his budget to provide a significant fiscal stimulus to prop up the economy in the coming storm.</a> Days later it was obsolete and further measures of a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51935467">mortgage holiday and banning of evictions</a></span> had to be introduced with <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/business-51982005">extraordinary steps taken later still to protect workers.</a>  More may still be needed in the coming weeks.</p>
            <p>Due to the sheer gravity of what is required to tackle this pandemic the government appears to have sought to bring the people along with them by attempting to explain the reasoning behind their response.  The CMO and CSA calmly and clearly <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/news/covid-19-government-announces-moving-out-of-contain-phase-and-into-delay">outlined how the disease could no longer be contained and the strategy had to shift to delaying its spread.</a> The continuous messaging of what people could do that ensued helped to partially ingrain the required behavioural changes needed for this stage of the outbreak.</p>
            <p>This acclimatisation was vital in getting the wider population to understand that this pandemic isn’t a short affair and would actually be rather prolonged. Extreme measures would have to be introduced at some point but for them to be sustainable over the extended period it had to be communicated what would ultimately be involved.  Hopefully as a result the lockdown won’t be as much of a surprise as it may otherwise have been.</p>
            <p>In addition to this the government’s decisions to date have had a number of very difficult calculations behind them.  As the outbreak has been modelled there has been a balancing of risk and tough calls of when to act because acting too soon could be just as bad as acting too late.  The decision to close the schools is a good example of this. Children appear to be the least susceptible group to the disease thus keeping the schools open was deemed to be the safer option in the earlier stages because if the schools were closed it risked children spreading the virus to vulnerable groups (ie their grandparents).  The degree to which children spread the virus was also a somewhat unknown quantity further complicating the judgement call. <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-51952314">Ultimately they were closed</a>, but as other sections of society were also closing down as well.</p>
            <p>One silver lining is that this crisis has engendered a new and welcome spirit of bipartisanship in our politics after years of polarisation. <span style="text-decoration: underline;"><a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/mar/23/mps-to-review-coronavirus-emergency-laws-every-six-months">Labour and the other opposition parties have broadly gotten behind the government’s approach</a></span> but they aren’t giving them a free pass by any means as they are assiduously scrutinising any perceived deficiencies in their proposed mitigations.</p>
            <p>Even here in Northern Ireland the political class have formed a united front.  This did <a href="https://www.belfasttelegraph.co.uk/news/northern-ireland/michelle-oneill-calls-for-northern-ireland-schools-to-close-over-coronavirus-39042109.html">get off to a somewhat rocky start</a> with their initial unanimity breaking down along the predictable and tiresome identitarian lines <a href="https://www.derryjournal.com/health/coronavirus-statements-full-arlene-foster-and-michelle-oneill-covid-19-response-2498492">but it quickly came back together again after the seriousness of the task ahead set in.</a>  The coming months will very much prove their worth.</p>
            <p>Going forward we face a huge disruption to our everyday lives.  Our personal freedom will be curtailed in a way that will be utterly alien to us but remember it is temporary.  We will get through this crisis and be stronger for it. Only by taking this drastic action can we slow the spread of this virus and save lives, it is worth it.</p>
            <p>It’s important to remember that we as individuals aren’t powerless in the face of this pandemic.  By all of us doing the little things we can make a big difference and we all know what to do. Wash your hands, stay at home and keep your distance from other people. Often it’s the simplest things that have the biggest impact.</p>
            <p>This decision to impose a lockdown wasn’t taken lightly but it is necessary and thankfully it won’t last forever.  While it endures be sure to take care of yourself. There’s a life to get back to afterwards.</p>
