            <p>As we begin to settle into our state of lockdown it finally gives us a chance to catch up on all those series we’ve been meaning to get into.  Freed from our busy lives and in dire need of entertainment we can at last get round to watching those most recent episodes that passed us by when we were in the rat race.</p>
            <p>Being in a high risk group for the virus that currently blights us I have found myself at even more of a loose end than most people so streaming services have been my friend.  As a result of this situation I took the opportunity to get through the most recent instalment from the Star Trek franchise on Amazon Prime, Picard.  Without a doubt it is the best Star Trek outing we’ve had in years.</p>
            <p>Now that may sound like high praise but in reality it’s quite the damning indictment or a once great cultural phenomenon.  From a position of dominance in TV sci-fi in the 90s it has had a mixed record since the start of the 2000s. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Enterprise">The prequel series Enterprise</a> was cancelled in 2004 just as it was finding its feet then the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek_(film)">JJ Abrams reboot of the film series</a> had a rather mixed reception and now <a href="https://www.radiotimes.com/news/film/2020-03-03/star-trek-4-might-not-happen/">languishes in development/contract hell.</a></p>
            <p>With the modern renaissance in TV brought about by streaming the current owners, CBS, have tried to breathe new life into the franchise under the supervision of veteran writer/producer Alex Kurtzman.  The first offering from this new line up was Star Trek Discovery, <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/tv/star_trek_discovery">a critically acclaimed show loathed by the audience.</a></p>
            <p>Discovery was not a show I particularly cared for, it looked great but alas the writing was lazy and shallow. This manifested itself in the woke politics of the production team being on full display in every aspect of the production.  Now politics in Star Trek isn’t a bad thing per se but the partisan way everything was presented in Discovery felt preachy and took you out of the viewing experience.  I only made it through three to four episodes in before giving up on it.</p>
            <p>This brings us onto now, whereas Discovery was a prequel no one asked for, Picard is a sequel that many fans actually wanted.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_Nemesis">Set 20 years after the events of the 2002 film Nemesis</a> it stars Sir Patrick Stewart as the eponymous Starfleet Captain going off on a new mission.</p>
            <p>As with all modern sci-fi the world building for the series is as good as we have come to expect, non-existent to nonsensical.  The series is set in <a href="https://memory-alpha.fandom.com/wiki/Alternate_reality">the timeline established by the JJ Abrams movies</a>, where the Romulan homeworld was destroyed in some offscreen supernova.  Along with this the series features a version of the Federation that has become isolationist and insular due to a major catastrophe where all the androids (inexplicably referred to as Synths now) went full Terminator on everyone and thus artificial life has since been outlawed.</p>
            <p>The plot mainly revolves around Sir Patrick being in a race against time to rescue a young Syth girl from a shadowy Romulan conspiracy and it's mediocre to say the least.  The pacing is also rather uneven as they start off trying to build a sense of urgency to get the mission underway and then the moment things get going we immediately go into a pointless side quest that doesn’t add anything to the plot where they pick up a sidekick who then proceeds to do nothing for the remainder of the series.  Even when we get to the main objective six episodes in the cast just sort of kill time waiting for the finale to arrive.</p>
            <p>Despite the lacklustre plot the show isn’t all bad, what they lack in storytelling they make up for in mindless action.  The nostalgia factor also does a lot of heavy lifting as well, with Picard and the other cameos from the previous TV instalments being established entities you sort of already care about what’s going on.  Had the show revolved around a bunch of new fangled creations I’m not too sure I’d have made it all the way through.  In addition to this the fan service is also rather well done in my opinion, whilst not exactly subtle it’s infinitely more muted than what we have seen in the recent Star Wars films.</p>
            <p>The tone of the show is also somewhat dark and brooding, like most modern shows. This along with the more morally grey world they paint has upset many fans with it being quite the departure from the rather upbeat and utopian outlook of the Picard’s original TV outing, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Star_Trek:_The_Next_Generation">The Next Generation</a>.  Not being a Star Trek purist (and a cynical Brit) this aspect of the show doesn’t greatly bother me, in fact I rather like it as I feel it makes the show more realistic whereas the naive, irrepressible idealism of previous iterations in the franchise did grate on me from time to time.</p>
            <p>In terms of politics Picard also is a massive improvement over Star Trek Discovery, the woke partisan messaging is there but it’s a lot more in the background.  In this area they are helped by the shoddy world building which obscures the writers’ attempts to make cack-handed allegories, you either shrug it off or simply don’t notice.  There was some concern that producer’s and Sir Patrick’s political leanings would colour the show, just before its launch <a href="https://variety.com/2020/tv/features/patrick-stewart-star-trek-picard-cbs-all-access-1203459573/">Stewart said in an interview with Variety</a> he was “responding to the world of Brexit and Trump”.  Fortunately this is nowhere near as overt as some feared, whether by accident or design though it is hard to tell.</p>
            <p>All in all Picard isn’t exactly great TV (or great Star Trek for that matter) but it’s entertaining enough.  It held my attention all the way through, which is more than I can say for Star Trek Discovery or even the most recent series of Doctor Who.  Compared to other Star Trek series you really have to turn your brain off much more than you normally would to enjoy it but in the current climate that is no bad thing.</p>
            <p>If you fancy a sci-fi action romp and are a fan of Sir Patrick Stewart then it’s definitely worth a watch.  If you’re looking for an updated version of The Next Generation then perhaps go and watch Seth MacFarlane’s The Orville instead.</p>
